# New Generation Data Models and DBMSs Project

This repository contains my solution to the project for the 2023 / April 2025 edition of the "New 
Generation Data Models and DBMSs" course in the Master's degree in Computer Science at UNIMI.

To better understand the work done, I recommend starting with the `Documentation` directory, where you will find all the documentation that explains and justifies the entire solution. Specifically, I suggest beginning with the `New Generation Data Models and DBMSs Project.pdf` file, which is the PDF report that explains the entire project. This report was generated automatically from the Jupyter notebook `New Generation Data Models and DBMSs Project.ipynb` (located in the same directory), which allows you to retrace and execute all the steps I took to complete the project without needing a local instance of the database. You would only need to install a few basic Python packages if they are not already installed.

At the same level as the `Documentation` directory, you will find the `Neo4j` directory, which contains executable Python scripts for all the code shown in the previously mentioned notebook. Additionally, the `Generated_DBs` folder contains the CSV files automatically generated by the Python scripts in the `GenerationScript` folder, which are intended to be imported into the database.
